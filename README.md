# Coins

This API calls the coinmarketcap API to get the current bitcoin price and uses that information to calculate the price if the user sells or buys at a certain margin.

## Built With

- Rails
- GraphQL

## Live version
[See the graphiql interface](https://buycoinsgraphql2.herokuapp.com/graphiql)

We have an `allCryptos` type and a `calculatePrice` query within it that takes 3 arguments with their types.`types: string`, `margin: float` and `exchangeRate: float`
